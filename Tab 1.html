<h1><p style="color:mediumseagreen" align="center" font face="verdanabold"><u>LIFE BEFORE COLLEGE</h1></u>

<p><p style="color:lightskyblue" align="justify"> I started preschool when I was three or four. I was always a good student, from preschool to senior year of highschool. I averaged honor roll, with an occasional C here and there. All of my teachers growing up would tell my parents how well I worked in class... However I was known to talk a lot. Growing up my favorite subject was math, but growing up it had gradually changed to history.</p>

<p><p style="color:lightskyblue" align="justify"> Ever since I was little, sports have been a huge part of my life. At as young as four years old, I have been playing sports. I started out playing Soccer, basketball, and T-Ball. As I went to middle school, I transitioned from Soccer to Football, stopped playing basketball, and switched from baseball to track and field. In highschool I excelled in football, achieving 3 year of varsity, and my senior year achieving Divisional All-Star and playing in the Central Massachusetts All-Star game. when the spring of senior year came around, I qualified for the State-Wide Track and Field meet for javelin. My dad was my biggest fan and inspiration, as he coached me in football and baseball before highschool.</p>

<p><p style="color:lightskyblue" align="justify"> Before coming to the University of Maine, I applied to 5 other schools as well; The University of Rhode Island, UMass Dartmouth, Coastal Carolina University, Merrimack College, and Westfield State University. When choosing where to attend, I wanted to go out of state, but could not afford it. That is, until I found out that UMaine was allowing in-state tuition to Massachusetts residents. That greatly impacted my decision. Whether my major was offered had not really mattered because I was undeclared when deciding. Since then, I have declared into Business, with a focus in Marketing.</p>
